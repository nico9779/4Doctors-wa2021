## Introduction
Our goal for this project is to implement a web application where both patients and doctors can interact easily. Our case study is about a group of doctors that work together with a pool of patients. This kind of medical office organization is very common in italy. From the doctor side, the web application provides different services such as: remote prescriptions, a patient's manager, an examinations manager and other interesting features dedicated to facilitate the cooperation with patients. From the patient side, the user can ask for prescriptions, exams, checkups and so on, without the need to go in person at the medical office. Detailed explanation are reported in the **report** `./HW1 - 4Doctors Report.pdf`

## Presentation Slides 
The presentation slides are in the home directory of the repository, `./slides/4doctors-presentation.pdf`
